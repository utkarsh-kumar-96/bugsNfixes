Minimizing Laptop/Desktop temperatures

For Intel Machines

The Intel pstate driver automatically handles CPU frequency scaling according to system load.
Note that the Intel Pstate works only with kernels >= 3.9, and kernel 3.11+ is recommended.
Primary supported processor families are Intel Sandy Bridge (also known as 2nd generation of i3/5/7 processors) and up.
The Intel Thermal Daemon (thermald) can be installed to automatically manage the CPU temperature.
To install it, following command can be used:

$ sudo pacman -S thermald

After installing it needs to be configured to automatically start at boot in order to work:

$ sudo systemctl enable thermald
